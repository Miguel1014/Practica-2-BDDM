Practicing in was easy, because you explained the structure of Xamarin, we just did what you already did, 
without your help the truth would have been a little understood in learning this.

QUESTIONS

Question 1: What’s difference between Portable (CPL) and Shared (SAP) projects? 

Answer: Shared Project (SAP) uses a shared code model where you can use conditional compilation inside of the 
code file to do platform specific features.

Portable class library (CPL) does everything in a portable class library and you would use dependency injection to do platform specific stuff.

Question 2: What are the requirements to configure Xamarin Mac Agent? 


Answer: System Requirements

The system requirements are:

*Windows
Windows 7 or higher.
Visual Studio 2013 Professional or higher.
Xamarin for Visual Studio.

⚠️
NOTE: The Xamarin plug-in cannot be used with Express editions of Visual Studio due to lack of support for extensions.

*Macintosh
A Mac running OS X El Capitan (10.11) or higher (although the latest stable version is recommended).
Xamarin Studio 5.10 or higher (although the latest stable version is recommended)). This should be on the same 
distribution channel as Xamarin for Visual Studio.
Xamarin.iOS SDK.
Apple’s Xcode(7+) IDE and iOS SDK (although the latest stable version from the App Store is recommended)).

⚠️
NOTE: The Windows computer must be able to reach the Mac via the network.

*Compatibility
To ensure that matching Xamarin.iOS versions are installed on your Mac and Windows machines, you must be on the Stable release channel of 
Xamarin Studio.

Question 3: How many projects you have and why you need all? 

Answer: 

Tiene cuatro proyectos en total que son 
Portable
iOS
Android
UWP

When you create an Application Project or a Library Project, 
the resulting DLL is restricted to working on the specific platform it is created for. This prevents you from writing an 
assembly for a Windows app, and then re-using it on Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.

The iOS, Android and UWP projects are the native languages of each respectively.
